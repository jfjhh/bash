NAME
	`countdown' - A countdown timer.

SYNOPSIS
	countdown {-h, -H} {-i} [{-o, -t} time] {-n name}

DESCRIPTION
	Countdown will display a timer that will count down to zero. The time
	may be set via the switches -o and -t, and their argument the `time'
	string, in the format discussed below. The program uses 24-hour time,
	thus arguments can be from 0 through 23 for hours, and 0 - 60 for minutes
	and seconds. The smallest amount of time settable is one second, and
	other parameters will cause the usage message to be printed and exit.

OPTION SYNOPSIS
	The timer options are as follows:

	-h
		Prints the short help.

	-H
		Prints this long help.
	
	-i
		Immediately start and exit the timer, don't wait for a keypress.

	-o <time>
		For a timer that is an offset from now.
		`countdown -o "1:2:3"' sets a timer for 1 hour,
		2 minutes, and 3 seconds.

	-t <time>
		For a timer until a certain time.
		`countdown -o "9:30"', when issued at 8:00,
		sets a timer for 1 hour and 30 minutes;
		the exact time until 9:30.

	-n <name>
		For a timer with name `name' that follows the option.
		An example would be `countdown ... -n "Go to bed"'.
		Using this option will give the timer a name during the countdown,
		as well as printing that the timer finished by name: both in the
		terminal and via an Xfce otification (if you are using Xfce,
		otherwise nothing will happen in your desktop).

TIME STRING FORMAT
	The format of the `time' string is a three-field string delimited with
	either a colon `:' or space ` '. Each of the three fields corresponds
	to hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively, and cannot exceed the
	limit for the given option.

	The field maximum values for each time option is as follows:

	-t
		-h
			0 - 23
		-m
			0 - 59
		-s
			0 - 59

	-o
		-h
			0 - 99
		-m
			0 - 59
		-s
			0 - 59

	Example `time' strings are:

	-t
		"12:44:56"
		"21 43 07"
		"00:03:43"
		"08 23 00"

	-o
		"12:33:56"
		"21 49 07"
		"01:03:43"
		"98 23 10"

	The `name' string can be any string, so long as it is less than 42
	characters long.
